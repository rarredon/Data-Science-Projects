Some recent projects doing various analyses and using different machine learning methodologies. They include:
1. Beers: an analysis of beer ratings that I scraped from a popular beer rating website; ensemble methods are used to predict beer ratings
2. SeattleCrime: an analysis of Seattle crime data; clustering methods are evaluated for more efficient police force districts
